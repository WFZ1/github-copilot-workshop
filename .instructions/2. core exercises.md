## Workshop exercises

### Core exercise

The following exercises will help you get started with GitHub Copilot. You must have completed the [setup instructions](<./1. setup.md>) before starting these steps.

### Step by step instructions

1. Open the Visual Studio Code and create a new file with name **main.js**.

2. Let's start by adding the following comment to provide some context for the code we're about to write:
   `// Write a rock, paper, scissors game` :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:

3.  When you press **Enter** after typing the previous comment, GitHub Copilot will suggest some code (additional instructions) for you. Select the first suggestion by pressing **TAB** then **Enter** and repeat them again.

4. Then press **Enter**, GitHub Copilot will suggest some code for you (if not please type the name first function that Copilot suggested you for example `const computerPlay`). Select the first suggestion by pressing **TAB**.

5. Press **TAB** again for accept the rest parts of function. If it is not showing trigger inline suggestion by combination **ALT + \/** on Windows/Linux or **OPTION (‚å•) + \/** on macOS.

6. Now we need to write the second function. Press **Enter** and wait suggestions or start by typing `function playRound` and press **TAB** then **Enter** and repeat them again.

7. Now we're going to prompt GitHub Copilot to suggest code for us by typing the following:

`// define main function that handles all the logic` :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:

<img alt="Copilot Prompt - main function" src="../assets/Copilot Prompt - main func.png">

8. When you press **Enter** after typing the previous comment, GitHub Copilot will again suggest some code for you.

9. **Pause briefly** while Copilot creates up to 10 suggestions for you. You should see the Copilot icon in the lower right corner of the editor spinning. When Copilot displays the first suggestion, we're going to open the GitHub Copilot suggestion panel by pressing **CTRL + ENTER** on Windows / Linux or **CTRL + RETURN** on macOS.

10. Scroll down the list of suggestions that GitHub Copilot has made and choose the one that looks like the best option for our Rock, Paper, Scissors game. When you see the suggestion you want, click **Accept Solution** to have that code snippet inserted into your code file.

**Now we're ready to see if this code executes** :thumbsup:

> **NOTE:** To run the JavaScript code, you'll need to have Google Chrome or another modern browser installed on your computer.

11. Open Google Chrome (or another browser) then open console by pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + J` on Windows/Linux, `CMD + OPTION + J` on macOS.

12. Copy all code from Visual Studio Code then paste it to console and press **Enter** to run the code.

Here's an example of what the completed game might look like.

> Hopefully your Paper, Rock, Scissors game is working! Remember, GitHub Copilot is probabilistic so you may not get the exact same code suggestions as we did. If you're not happy with the suggestions, you can always press **CTRL + Z** to undo the changes and try again.

You're now ready to start the [challenge exercises](<./3. challenge exercises.md>) to see how you can leverage the power of GitHub Copilot to solve a number of challenges yourself.
