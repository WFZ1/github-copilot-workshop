<img width="400" alt="Rock Paper Scissors image" src="./assets/Rock Paper Scissors image.png">

In this fun workshop, you will learn how to use GitHub Copilot to build a simple game in JavaScript, with little to no coding experience required.

Estimated time to complete: `10 to 60 minutes`

Participants will be guided to install the GitHub Copilot VS Code extension, learn how to interact with GitHub Copilot, and then use GitHub Copilot to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game from scratch.

Depending on the time available, participants will be able to complete the game or just get started, from a simple version all the way to introducing additional logic to make the game more interesting complete.
